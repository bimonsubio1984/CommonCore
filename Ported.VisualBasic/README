This is a port of VB2008 library which has:
Information.IsNothing, etc.
Strings.Len, Right, Left, etc.
Conversion.
And many more

It just let you run existing VB code already today before Core V3 is released.

For examples following code works fine using ported lib:

DateAndTime.Year(D) & "" & Strings.Format(DateAndTime.Month(D), "00") & "(" & MonthNames(DateAndTime.Month(D) - 1) & ")" & Strings.Format(DateAndTime.Day(D), "00") & "__" & Strings.Format(DateAndTime.Hour(D), "00") & "" & Strings.Format(DateAndTime.Minute(D), "00") & "" & Strings.Format(DateAndTime.Second(D), "00")

If Information.UBound(A) = 2 Then
XXX = DateAndTime.DateSerial(A2(0), Strings.Left(A2(1), 2), A2(2))
End If

You know a lot of legacy code exists which is very desirable to run on Core ASAP.


Though this port is done in C# actually I am a VB.net guy with about 10 years of previous experience working remotely with an USA company.
If you are looking for any inexpensive remote paid help (having a part time job for me) with DotNet programming, Linux administration, 
Bot creation (like ZennoPoster automation and Pandora macroses), please contact me by e-mail or github:   bimonsubio1984 (at) gmail [dot] com
